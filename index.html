    <p> Hi Noah!!

Welcome to the AKPsi family!! 🩷🩷 I am so excited for you and your Big, and I have no doubt that you will absolutely thrive in this organization. 

Both you and your Big are some of the sweetest, kindest, and smartest people I’ve met! I cannot rave about your Big enough—they wear their heart on their sleeve, are always there for those around them, and are always striving and putting in the hard work to achieve their goals. They have this ability to make anyone feel like they belong, and I can already tell the two of you are the most perfect Big/Little pairing! I literally cannot think of anyone more capable and excited to be your mentor and friend through every step of this pledge process and beyond. You are INCREDIBLY lucky and blessed to have them by your side! 

Beyond just your Big, your entire family is full of the most remarkable people, who I’m lucky enough to call my friends. I am absolutely certain—zero doubt in my mind—that they will always be there to support you. This whole organization is truly a family, but that’s especially true of the iconic family line you’re joining.

I hope you have the most wonderful and joyful Big/Little week, and I can’t wait to see your reaction when you find out who your Big is! I am ALWAYS here for you if you need anything at all, and I am so excited to see your friendships grow as you join the most incredible family and organization!! 🩷🩷

Best,
Your Godbig</p>
