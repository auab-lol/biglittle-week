Happy big little! I am so incredibly excited to be your god big :) You are such a smart and motivated person, and I just know that you will do amazing things! During our interview, I had such an amazing time getting to know things about you, your friends, and your passions, and am excited to get closer after the reveal! I hope you enjoy all of your big/little week goodies and have no doubt that you will be very happy with your new family after the reveal! -GodBig #1

Hi Noah!!

Welcome to the AKPsi family!! 🩷🩷 I am so excited for you and your Big, and I have no doubt that you will absolutely thrive in this organization. 

Both you and your Big are some of the sweetest, kindest, and smartest people I’ve met! I cannot rave about your Big enough—they wear their heart on their sleeve, are always there for those around them, and are always striving and putting in the hard work to achieve their goals. They have this ability to make anyone feel like they belong, and I can already tell the two of you are the most perfect Big/Little pairing! I literally cannot think of anyone more capable and excited to be your mentor and friend through every step of this pledge process and beyond. You are INCREDIBLY lucky and blessed to have them by your side! 

Beyond just your Big, your entire family is full of the most remarkable people, who I’m lucky enough to call my friends. I am absolutely certain—zero doubt in my mind—that they will always be there to support you. This whole organization is truly a family, but that’s especially true of the iconic family line you’re joining.

I hope you have the most wonderful and joyful Big/Little week, and I can’t wait to see your reaction when you find out who your Big is! I am ALWAYS here for you if you need anything at all, and I am so excited to see your friendships grow as you join the most incredible family and organization!! 🩷🩷

Best,
Godbig #2

GodBig #3's Note is coming soon!! But surprise you might've met a roommate or best friend of mine!

    <h1>Letter from Your Big </h1>
    <p>Hey Noah! IT’S YOUR BIG!!!!!!!

Holy shit, it’s already Big & Little week!!
<br><br><br>
It’s been almost 2 weeks since I met you and let me just say how  insanely impressed by you I am every time I chat with you. Your commitment to furthering yourself in your academic and personal life is truly so remarkable, and I honestly mean it when I say you inspire me! 
<br><br><br>
Something that I find so memorable is your passion for learning more about yourself and your capabilities. Hearing about your own entrepreneurial tendencies with fixing and building PCs for FUN????? Like dude you are genuinely so so hype and I absolutely love our little conversations and banter. I was trying to think of different gifts to get you this week and I really wanted to try my best to get you things you’d actually use and remember me by! Starting with this website haha, I know it’s not the cutest… I unfortunately have little to no coding skills ,BUT I tried my best and had a little help.  
(#loveallyourfriends they are so funny and lit, your gf is one of the sweetest and cutest girls ever)
<br><br><br>
You are genuinely one of the funniest people I know. Everyone talks about how incredibly smart you are (triple major energy is actually insane), but what I love most is your wit and the way you don’t take yourself too seriously. You have this drive and ambition that’s so rare, and I mean it when I say that being your Big isn’t just me mentoring you, having you as my little has brought so much joy into my life.
<br><br><br>

I love how much we have in common, and also how much we don’t. I’m always learning something from you, and I feel so lucky and inspired that I got you. I need you to know that I’m here for you through everything — the stressful moments, the overwhelming ones, and even when college gets a little too fun and you need someone to tell you to lock in. I’ll always be in your corner, helping you find and chase the opportunities you deserve so you can become exactly who you see yourself being!
<br><br><br>
Good luck guessing dude.
<br><br><br><br>

-Your Big
