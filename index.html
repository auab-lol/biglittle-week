    <h1>Letter from Your Big </h1>
    <p>Hey Noah! IT’S YOUR BIG!!!!!!!

Holy shit, it’s already Big & Little week!!

It’s been almost 2 weeks since I met you and let me just say how  insanely impressed by you I am every time I chat with you. Your commitment to furthering yourself in your academic and personal life is truly so remarkable, and I honestly mean it when I say you inspire me! 

Something that I find so memorable is your passion for learning more about yourself and your capabilities. Hearing about your own entrepreneurial tendencies with fixing and building PCs for FUN????? Like dude you are genuinely so so hype and I absolutely love our little conversations and banter. I was trying to think of different gifts to get you this week and I really wanted to try my best to get you things you’d actually use and remember me by! Starting with this website haha, I know it’s not the cutest… I unfortunately have little to no coding skills ,BUT I tried my best and had a little help.  
(#loveallyourfriends they are so funny and lit, your gf is one of the sweetest and cutest girls ever)

You are genuinely one of the funniest people I know. Everyone talks about how incredibly smart you are (triple major energy is actually insane), but what I love most is your wit and the way you don’t take yourself too seriously. You have this drive and ambition that’s so rare, and I mean it when I say that being your Big isn’t just me mentoring you, having you as my little has brought so much joy into my life.


I love how much we have in common, and also how much we don’t. I’m always learning something from you, and I feel so lucky and inspired that I got you. I need you to know that I’m here for you through everything — the stressful moments, the overwhelming ones, and even when college gets a little too fun and you need someone to tell you to lock in. I’ll always be in your corner, helping you find and chase the opportunities you deserve so you can become exactly who you see yourself being!

Good luck guessing dude.


-Your Big
